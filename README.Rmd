# chmloader

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of chmloader is to download the Canopy Height Model (CHM) data from 
this recent work by [Tolan et al. (2023)](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2023/4/every-tree-counts-large-scale-mapping-of-canopy-height-at-the-resolution-of-individual-trees/)
The data is downloaded from aws s3 storage - further details on the bucket can
be found [here](https://registry.opendata.aws/dataforgood-fb-forests/)

## Installation

You can install the development version of chmloader like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("chmloader")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(chmloader)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
